# INSTRUCTIONS
# 
# 1. You need to install the gems "ruby-gmail", "libnotify", and "parseconfig".
# 
# 2. You need to populate the file ~/.gmail.conf to make it look something like
# this:
# 
#   email = myusername@gmail.com
#   password = mypassword
#   interval = 10
# 
# Replace 10 with the number of minutes you want the script to check for email.
# 
# 3. Make the script executable with "chmod +x /path/to/gmail-notifyd"
# 
# 4. Run the script with "/path/to/gmail-notifyd &" (in Bash), or
# "/path/to/gmail-notifyd &!" (in zsh).
# 
# This is a terrible ruby script, and is thus likely to break. You can always
# get the latest version from
# https://github.com/pharpend/dotfiles/tree/master/bin/gmail-notifyd
