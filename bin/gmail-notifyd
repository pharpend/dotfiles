# 
# INSTRUCTIONS
# 
# 1. You need to install the gems "ruby-gmail", "libnotify", and "parseconfig".
# 
# 2. You need to populate the file ~/.gmail.conf to make it look, at a minimum,
# something like this:
# 
#   email = myusername@gmail.com
#   password = mypassword
# 
# Replace 10 with the number of minutes you want the script to check for
# email. You can get the value of MYHOSTNAME by typing "hostname" in the
# terminal.
# 
# 3. Make the script executable with "chmod +x /path/to/gmail-notifyd"
# 
# 4. Run the script with "/path/to/gmail-notifyd".
#

# 
# DESCRIPTION
# 
# Every so often, this program checks to see if there are new messages in a
# Gmail inbox. If so, it sends a desktop notification. It will also output the
# number of new messages to a file.
# 
# This is a terrible Ruby script, and is thus likely to break. You can always
# get the latest version from
# https://github.com/pharpend/dotfiles/tree/master/bin/gmail-notifyd
#
# This has been tested on Gentoo GNU/Linux, last updated 30 Sept 2014
# 
# You can edit some global parameters here.
