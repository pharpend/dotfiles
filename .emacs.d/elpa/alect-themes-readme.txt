This package provides light and dark color-themes for GNU Emacs 24 or
later.  These themes were intended to be used with a GUI.  Use those
in terminal at your own risk :)

Screenshots are available at <http://github.com/alezost/alect-themes>

It is possible to modify color palette for the themes by customizing
`alect-colors' variable (you may use `alect-generate-colors' function
for that -- see the code).

If you use one (or both) of these themes and want it to support a
major mode the faces of which are not supported yet, you may send me
a letter to add it.
