A combination of zenburn-emacs by Bozhidar Batsov and Ample Theme
by Jordon Biondo.  This theme is built with Emacs 24.  Based on version
0.2.4 of ample-theme found at
https://github.com/jordonbiondo/ample-theme and version 2.1 of
zenburn-emacs found at http://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs

Mostly, I liked the colors of ample and the better highlighting and
and robustness of zenburn
