Eclipse Color Theme for Emacs.
==============================

Emacs color theme based on the Eclipse's default syntax highlighting.

To use add the following to your .emacs file (requires the color-theme package):

(require 'color-theme)
(color-theme-initialize)
(require 'color-theme-eclipse)

If you don't want to use color theme library for some reasons (8-color's terminal),
try the following very simple font-lock setting like eclipse to your	  .emacs.

(set-face-foreground 'font-lock-comment-face "ForestGreen")
(set-face-foreground 'font-lock-comment-delimiter-face "ForestGreen")
(set-face-foreground 'font-lock-string-face "RoyalBlue3")
(set-face-foreground 'font-lock-keyword-face "dark magenta")
(set-face-foreground 'font-lock-function-name-face "MediumBlue")
(set-face-foreground 'font-lock-variable-name-face "grey25")
;;(set-face-foreground 'font-lock-variable-name-face "blue")
(set-face-foreground 'font-lock-type-face "purple4")
(set-face-foreground 'font-lock-constant-face "CadetBlue")
(set-face-foreground 'font-lock-builtin-face "purple")
(set-face-foreground 'font-lock-warning-face "Red")
